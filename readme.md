## JSync
JSync is a Java program that connects multiple computers together to unite them under the master computer's mouse and keyboard. This product is similar to the commercial product Synergy, except this is free and open source. Because this is a Java application, this makes it easier to develop and function on many common platforms.

# Features
Because this is still a WIP, there are no features as of now, but I plan to have the following:
1. Control of other PC's using mouse and keyboard.
2. Support for multiple monitors.
3. Cross-device clipboard.
4. Non-native file transfer.
5. Seamless transition of control by moving mouse past monitor boundary.
6. Customizable orientation.
